===========
This repository contains daily workflows captured in scripts. For anyone else, these scripts are probably better for reading than for running.  No serious attempt is made to ensure portability across systems beyond whatever systems on which I need to use the script at any given time.  However, pull requests to improve the scripts and increase their robustness or portability are welcome.
